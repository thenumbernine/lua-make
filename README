first I made a decent Makefile system
got it working on OSX, Linux, MinGW ... all but MSVC
then I found myself wanting to build stuff with MSVC ... without making those stupid .vcproj files, or another NMAKE script, or rewriting everything
because, if you have to rewrite everything, why use a shitty one-platform shit-tool to do it?
so I found myself in need of a rewrite.
hence this simple build system.

it reads files labelled 'buildinfo'
each buildinfo specifies the distribution name, type, and any dependencies.
they optionally can have a depend() function that sets up any other dependencies needed for projects that depend on them.
