Yes, this is yet *another* build system.

First I made a decent Makefile system.
I got it working on OSX, Linux, MinGW ... all but MSVC.
Then I found myself wanting to build stuff with MSVC ... without making those stupid .vcproj files, or another NMAKE script, or rewriting everything.
Because, if you have to rewrite everything, why use a shitty one-platform shit-tool to do it, like MSVC's stuff?
So I found myself in need of a rewrite.
Hence this simple build system.

It reads files labeled 'buildinfo'
Each buildinfo specifies the distribution name, type, and any dependencies.
They optionally can have a depend() function that sets up any other dependencies needed for projects that depend on them.

usage:

if you're lazy:
	lua -lmake

if you really want to do stuff:
	lua /path/to/lua/make/run.lua clean distclean all
